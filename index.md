[Tambi](./tambi.md) is the main program for studying the bible (and much more).

# Kulanday #

[Kulanday](./kulanday.md) is the software for collecting words and phrases for learning languages. Its main components are an interface for creating new entries for a single word or phrase enriched with one or more audio recordings (or already existing audio-material) and an image. This data can be later used for the learning-modes and of course to be used as a dictionary or for analysing the language.
